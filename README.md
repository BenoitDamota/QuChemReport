# QuChemReport

QuChemReport is a Python module for molecular quantum chemistry calculations results. 

The project was started in 2010 by Thomas CAUCHY, assistant professor in the MOLTECH-Anjou laboratory of the University of Angers (FRANCE).
At first a computational chemist program maintained by Thomas CAUCHY and Yohann MORILLE, the project boomed with the involvment of Benoit DA MOTA. 
Benoit DA MOTA is a computer scientist assistant professor of the LERIA laboratory of the University of Angers.
